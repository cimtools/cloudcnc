Cloud CNC is an online CNC lathe simulator. It lets you edit and simulate CNC lathe code
online. This is an HTML5 application with no server side interaction. The code is parsed in
JS and simulation is performed using HTML5 Canvas and web workers for multithreading.
Other features include simulation speed control, pause/resume & breakpoints for pausing
the program at particular source lines.
